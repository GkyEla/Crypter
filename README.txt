Make sure use pycharm or Visual studio and download some of the libraries your computer needs. (run the code; it will show you what it needs.)

put crypter.py in a file

put your malware in the same file and change the name to payload.exe

now run crypter.py and it will generate encrypted_payload.exe

Enjoy!
